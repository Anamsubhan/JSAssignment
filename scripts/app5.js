// In this task, you will be creating two empty arrays called "contactNumbers" and
// "contactNames". Using the prompt, you will ask the user to enter a contact number
// and contact name. You will then push these values into their respective arrays
// using the push method. After adding all the contacts, you will display the contact
// numbers and names in the console. To do this, you will need to use a for loop to
// iterate through both arrays and log each element to the console.


var contactNames = []
var contactNumber = []
for (let i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
    contactNames[i] = prompt("Enter Name")
    contactNumber[i] = prompt("Enter Number")
    contactNames.push(name)
    contactNumber.push(Number)

}

for (let i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
    console.log(contactNames[i] + "  " + "  " + contactNumber[i])
}
